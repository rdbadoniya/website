    <h1>GST </h1>
    <p>GST, or Goods and Services Tax, is an indirect tax imposed on the supply of goods and services. It is a multi-stage, destination-oriented tax imposed on every value addition, replacing multiple indirect taxes, including VAT, excise duty, service taxes, etc.</p>
    <h3>Key Features of GST:</h3>
    <p>Single Tax System: GST replaces a multitude of indirect taxes with a single tax, simplifying the tax structure.</p>
     <p> Destination-Based Taxation: The tax is collected at the point of consumption, rather than the point of origin.</p>
     <p> Input Tax Credit (ITC): Businesses can claim credit for taxes paid on purchases, reducing their overall tax liability.</p>
      <p>Four Tax Slabs: GST is levied at 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, depending on the type of goods and services.</p>
      <p>Digital Tax Filing: GST promotes transparency through its online tax payment and return filing system.</p>
    <h3>Benefits of GST:<h3>
      <p>Simplified Tax Structure: A unified system replacing multiple indirect taxes.</p>
      <p>Boosts Economic Growth: Reduces the tax burden on businesses, encouraging investment.</p>
      <p>Promotes Compliance: Digital filing makes tax compliance easier for businesses.</p>
      <p>Reduces Cascading Effect: Ensures that tax is only paid on the value addition at each stage.</p>
